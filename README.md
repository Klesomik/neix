**neix** needs two configuration files. One for itself and one for the feeds which should be loaded.

|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| neix.conf  | This is the main configuration. It include's the date format, locale and the open command. |
| feeds.conf | This is the feed list. An entry represents a single news feed.                             |

### :nut_and_bolt: neix.conf
This is the main config file of **neix**.
