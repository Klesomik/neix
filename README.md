## :wrench: Configuration
Default directory of the config files: **~/.config/neix/**   
During the installtion process, **neix** create's the default directory with the needed configuration files.  

**neix** needs two configuration files. One for itself and one for the feeds which should be loaded.  
| File       | Description                                                                                |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| neix.conf  | This is the main configuration. It include's the date format, locale and the open command. |
| feeds.conf | This is the feed list. An entry represents a single news feed.                             |

### :nut_and_bolt: neix.conf
This is the main config file of **neix**.
| Option      | Value                                                                                                                                                                  |

| openCommand | Here you can which programm should be used to open the article link. Default is **xdg-open**. You can use what you want.                                               |

### :nut_and_bolt: feeds.conf
This file contains the list of feeds you want to read.
